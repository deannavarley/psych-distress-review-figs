This repository contains interactive figures accompanying the article "Identifying Psychological Distress Data Available in Nationally Representative Surveys: A Scoping Review and Case Study of Australian Surveys". 
In this article, we systematically identified and described available representative psychological distress data from Australia, provided a case study illustrating how datasets can be systematically summarized to assist researchers to more easily identify available datasets, and provided an online, searchable metadata database for 282 identified datasets.
The interactive figures stored in this repository visualise 1) sample age ranges by survey year for all datasets/studies identified, 2) sample age ranges by survey year for all cross-sectional datasets/studies identified, 3) sample age ranges by survey year for all longitudinal datasets/studies identified, 4) the frequency of psychological distress instrument use by study, and 5) the frequency of surveying other domains/measuring other covariates by study.
